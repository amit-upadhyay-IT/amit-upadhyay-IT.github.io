A **AIT student** by day, a human developer by night. Coding is happiness (but not always :-1: ) I love to play with languages &try to learn new things every day.

For developers, I welcome you to this page and I have got a message for you : **"The only way out is through."**


**What do I know?**

I'm fluent in: **Java**, **C++**, **JavaScript**, **C** and **Ruby**. Despite the fact, I really love Java, at times I blame it for its verbosity. I have screwed about a bit with **Python** (I love this language too. But never really did any project on this).

Framework-wise, I've worked heavily with **Android**, built one app for a company as a **freelancer**. Worked with Android just enough to hate it. After android, the next thing that engages me is the **node.js applications**. I m decently familiar with **MEAN stack** (don't know much about 'A' : AngularJS :P).

As far as the database is concerned, I'm thoroughly experienced with **MongoDB** and decently familiar with **MySQL**.

Then there are SAAS systems: I've worked with **Firebase** just enough, dabbled with **IBM Bluemix** and enjoyed it, waiting to use **AWS** in future.

I think I’m a little lazy developer and that's what make me difficult to work on building Android Apps. Being lazy inspires (or even forces) me to constantly explore for things and techniques which makes my job much easier.

Hence, I generate everything I can generate. I generate the gitignore file, package.json, constructors… I don’t even create methods manually, well no, I do, but only when I'm using IDE other IntelliJ IDEA. For programming other things I use VIM editor. I love using Linux, MAC. Don;t actually remember the last time I used windows in my PC. 


Sometimes the only way to move forward is to revisit the things in your past that were holding you back. You have to deal with them head on, no matter how scary they may be. Because once we do, you'll see that you can go further than you ever imagined.

I contribute back to the programmers' community here on  **MinimumStack.com** and of course on **StackOverflow**
