#### 2. [Set the `Kth` bit of a number.]()

#### 3. [Clear the `Kth` bit of a number.]()

#### 4. [Toggle `Kth` bit of a number.]()

#### 5. [Count the numbers of set bits in a number.]()

#### 6. [Check whether given number is power of `2` or not.]()

#### 7. [Find the next higher number of a given number also it should be a power of `2`.]()

#### 8. [Check whether a given number if power of `4` or not.]()

#### 9. [Multiply a given number with `7` without using multiplication and division operator.]()

#### 10. [Given a number, mask it in such a way that it leaves just the last `K` bits.]()

#### 11. [Given a number, clear all the bits from `k` to `0`(inclusive).]()

#### 12. [You are given a 32 bit numbers, `N` and `M`, and two bit positions, `i` and `j`. Write a method to insert `M` into `N` such that `M` starts at bit `j` and ends at bit `i`. Assume that the bits `j` through `i` have enough space to fil all of `M`.]()

#### 13. [Given a real number between `0` and `1` (eg. 0.72) that is passed in as a double, print the binary representation. If the number cannot be represented accurately in binary with at most `32` characters, print "Error".]()

#### 14. [Given a positive integer, print the next smallest and the next largest number that have same number of `1` bits in their binary representation.]()

#### 15. [Explain what the following code does: `(n & (n-1))`.]()

#### 16. [Write a function to determine the number of bits you would need to flip to convert integer A to integer B.]()
