  <h5>What is a middleware?</h5>
</div>

Any kind of standard processing that happens on the server side between the time when a `request` is received and when the `response` is send to the browser. The library supporting that kind of standard processing is called `middleware` library.

**Examples of middleware**:

- [static](https://expressjs.com/en/starter/static-files.html)
- [body-parser](https://github.com/expressjs/body-parser)
- [express-session](https://github.com/expressjs/session)
- [ejs](https://github.com/mde/ejs)
- [jade](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jade)
- [handlebars](http://handlebarsjs.com/)

I already have taught you about the `static` express middleware. You are going to see more examples of middlewares as you go along with the next tutorials.
